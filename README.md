Open Quest Converted to the Wintermute Engine
=============================================

This is a port of Michael Sheail's two room demo game, OpenQuest.  It was originally made for Adventure Game Studio, then the ScummC team converted it to ScummC and now it's been converted to use the Wintermute engine.

It is being optimized for use with the Wintermute engine in ScummVM, which was developed by somaen, t0by, and the ScummVM team (the version that is bundled with the WIP snapshots of this game is 1.8.1, unmodified).
